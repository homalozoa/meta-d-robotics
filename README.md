# meta-d-robotics

`meta-d-robotics` is a Wrynose-compatible OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for
the D-Robotics RDK X5.

The supported vendor baseline is RDKOS 3.5.0.  Recipes use exact revisions from
official D-Robotics source repositories; developer-local source trees and
unversioned vendor branches are intentionally unsupported inputs.

## Scope

The layer is being delivered in independently buildable steps:

1. RDK X5 machine metadata, Linux 6.1.83, boot artifacts, and a TF-card WIC
   image compatible with the official NAND-resident boot contract.
2. Board runtime support for networking, firmware, and system configuration.
3. An opt-in BPU, camera, and multimedia packagegroup after its kernel and ELF
   ABI dependency closure has been verified.

The layer does not update miniboot or U-Boot in NAND as part of an image build
or TF-card flash.

## Dependencies

The initial layer depends on OpenEmbedded-Core and declares compatibility only
with the `wrynose` release series.  Additional layer dependencies are added
only when a recipe requires them.

The supported host entry point lives in `meta-saha`:

```sh
cd /home/homalozoa/yocto/meta-saha
./scripts/saha-build rdk-x5
```

Set `SAHA_D_ROBOTICS_DIR` if this layer is not located in the workspace's
default `x5_flash/meta-d-robotics` path.

## Compatibility policy

- Central release metadata owns every RDK X5 source revision.
- Hardware recipes are limited to `rdk-x5` with `COMPATIBLE_MACHINE`.
- Vendor binaries are split into runtime, development, tools, and samples.
- Prebuilt ELF objects are audited for architecture, interpreter, SONAME,
  `DT_NEEDED`, GLIBC/GLIBCXX symbol versions, and kernel ABI compatibility.
- No global Yocto QA suppression or global legacy-library provider replacement
  is permitted.

See `docs/` for the generated release/source matrix and boot contract once
those recipes are introduced.

## Layer checks

Run the metadata guard locally with:

```sh
bash tests/test-layer-metadata.sh
```

The complete parse/build validation runs through the pinned `meta-saha`
Docker/kas workflow.
